# myradius

MyRadius is a mobile application that aids in the slowing of coronavirus spread. During 
Movement Control Orders, MyRadius provides a function for monitoring group movement 
(MCO). One of the government's Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Covid 19 states 
that an individual can only leave the house within a 10 kilometer radius. MyRadius has a 
function that can help prevent anyone from leaving the radius. When the user scans the 
MySejahtera QR code before entering a store or any groceries that is outside of their city, a 
notification will appear either the user inside or outside radius.
